Implementation of a RISC: "SIMP"- a simplified version of the "MIPS" ISA.
The ISA consists of simulated memory, registers, hardware registers (for simulated hardware such as hard disk, LEDs, monitor, etc), and interrupts.

Assembler: converts assembly code to machine language which is fed to the CPU simulator, written in C.  
CPU simulator: decodes and executes given instructions, written in C.  
Test programs in assembly: written in "SIMP", inputs for the assembler and the CPU simulator programs for testing.
